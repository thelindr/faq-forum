    question: "how do i turn off my pocket operator?",
    answer: `
      pocket operators auto power off after 5 minutes of inactivity. in this state all patterns and settings will be saved, leaving only the LCD lit.

      this state draws very little power so there is no need to remove batteries. if there is a cable connected in the line in, the unit will auto power off after 60 minutes of inactivity. press any key to wake the unit after sleep.

      * remove the 2 x AAA batteries from the holder on the back side of the pocket operator.
      * use a spudger, pencil or similar tool, to remove the batteries out of their holder.
      * carefully adjust the four short-end connectors of the battery holder inwards slightly tighter towards each side.
      * insert two new fully charged batteries, and see if connection is established.
      * make sure the positive (+) and negative (-) poles of the batteries are well connected with the holder connectors on pocket operator, thus closing the circuit allowing unit to turn on.

      * hold the key on the right, just below knob B, and press bpm toggle sync modes.
      * keep holding and press bpm repeatedly to toggle between different modes.
      * there are 5 sync modes, where default is mode SY0 (sync off).
      * when sync is used the signal will be split between audio (right) and sync (left). modes 2-5 are available when a cable is connected to line in.

      LÄNK MED VIDEO - HUR FUNKAR DET?

      please note: for external triggering make sure you use the right sync polarity, and that you use a signal that is maximum 5 Vpp (volt peak-to peak). any stronger signals need to be reduced before they can be used. failing to do so may harm the input and will not be covered by warranty.
